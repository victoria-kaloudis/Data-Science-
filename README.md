# Victoria Kaloudis – Data Science Journey

Welcome! This repository tracks my progress as I develop technical skills in data science and analytics, building on my background in biochemistry and pharmaceutical strategy.

## Current Status
I recently completed the **Learn SQL Basics for Data Science** courses through Coursera (offered by UC Davis). The courses focused on writing SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and analyze structured data—skills foundational to real-world evidence and healthcare analytics. It also focused on problem solving while writing SQL queries and how to approach, address, and solve these problems.

I am currently working on the **Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification** through uCertify. This program builds on my SQL knowledge and emphasizes data modeling, visualization, and the use of DAX to generate business insights from complex datasets.


## Upcoming Certifications
This is the first step in a structured learning path. I’ll continue expanding this repository as I work through:

- Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
- Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate
- IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
- SAS Data Science Certification

## About Me
With several years of experience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, I work closely with clinical and commercial data, CRM systems, and market strategy. I'm now focused on pivoting into more technical, data-centric roles within healthcare and life sciences.

## Planned Repo Structure
This repository will eventually include:
- `sql-practice/` – SQL challenges and learnings from StrataScratch, LeetCode, etc.
- `certification-notes/` – Summaries and key concepts from each certification
- `powerbi-dashboards/` – Screenshots and summaries of dashboard projects
- `healthcare-projects/` – Applied case studies using public datasets
